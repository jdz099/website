            Shinmen Takezo was a young man consumed by a raw and untamed nature, referred to as a "beast" by everyone around him. Brash, violent, and antisocial, he had a thirst for proving his strength. As the son of a feared and scorned swordsman, he was already destined to be an outcast before he was born.

            Together with his friend, Matahachi, the two left their village with the hopes of making a name for themselves as samurai. Their first battle ended in defeat, and they were labeled as fugitives for siding with the losing army. Seeking out shelter in a distant village, Matahachi, tempted by a new life, stayed behind. Takezo, on the other hand, was ashamed and persistent on his goal. Before continuing his journey, he returned to their home village to inform Matahachi's family of his survival, only to be falsely accused of murder and sentenced to death by starvation, tied to a tree.

            Takezo was careless. Whether he lived or died didn't matter to him. A local monk, however, was determined to save him. In the moments of secretly giving Takezo food, the monk would force him into introspection by making him take a look at the life he was living, and the position he had gotten himself into. For the first time, Takezo was forced to sit with his thoughts and feelings that he had blocked away for years. Throughout this, he came to the realization that his unwavering determination for proving himself in strength was instilled in him at a young age by his abusive father. Reflecting on these events for the first time in his life and coming to the realization that the strength he had spent all this time seeking was not for himself, but for trying to soothe a traumatic past, caused him to do something else for the first time - cry. This was exactly what the monk intended. He wanted Takezo to awaken to lifeâ€™s deeper meaning, starting with self-awareness.

            After freeing Takezo from the tree, the monk blessed him with a new name: Miyamoto Musashi. This symbolized a new part in his life
